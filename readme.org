This library enables the completion of C/C++ header file names using [[http://company-mode.github.io][Company mode]] for Emacs.

When you type an ~#include~ declaration within a supported major mode (currently ~c-mode~, ~c++-mode~ and ~objc-mode~), company-c-headers will search for header files within predefined search paths. company-c-headers can search "system" and "user" paths, depending on the type of ~#include~ declaration you type.

During completion, the path to the current candidate is made available as metadata, and can be seen in the minibuffer in the screenshot above. Also during completion, you can use @@html:<kbd>@@C-w@@html:</kbd>@@ to temporarily display the currently-selected header file.

This library is inspired by [[https://github.com/mooz/auto-complete-c-headers][auto-complete-c-headers]].

** Installation

The best way to install this package is via [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]].

** Setup

With the company-c-headers library added to the ~load-path~, all you need to do to initialize it is:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'company-backends 'company-c-headers)
#+END_SRC

Typically you would want to customize the search paths, which you can do using @@html:<kbd>@@M-x customize-group@@html:</kbd>@@, @@html:<kbd>@@company-c-headers@@html:</kbd>@@.

Alternatively, you can bind the =company-c-headers-path-system= and =company-c-headers-path-user= variables to functions which return the corresponding paths. This allows integration with project-based libraries such as [[https://github.com/randomphrase/ede-compdb][EDE-compdb]].
